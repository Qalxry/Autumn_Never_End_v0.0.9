## C++ Galgame Simple Demo Based on Windows Command Prompt

This is a simple demo of a Galgame entirely based on the Windows Command Prompt (CMD). It provides basic functionality, including pixel animation playback, the use of the "Fangzheng Pixel 12" font, music playback, pixel image display (based on virtual terminal sequences), multi-buffer rendering acceleration, and simple user interaction.

Please note: This program is designed to run exclusively on the Windows Command Prompt and cannot run properly on Windows Terminal (the new default terminal in Windows 11) or Linux Shell because it relies on CMD API.

## Features
